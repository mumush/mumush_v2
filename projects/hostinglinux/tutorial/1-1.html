            <p>
                VPS (Virtual Private Server) is basically your own private island, where you have complete control, located on a larger dedicated server. This way, even if several websites are hosted on the same physical machine, your website can still be fully independent from the other websites.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why use VPS Hosting?</h2>

            <p>
                There are several benefits to using VPS to host your site. For one thing, it gives you provacy. You have total control over your section, and no one else is able to access your files. VPS also allows for customization. Since it allows you to have your own operating system, you can customize the services you use (ie. Apache) the way you want it to be. As stated earlier, since this is your own private island, you have complete control and it is seperated from others that are also on that server. You would be able to restart your section without having it affect anyone else. Lastly, you have a dedicated amount of RAM that is available to you, which you can choose when, how, and the amount you want to use. VPS is perfect for you if you feel that you have outgrown the resources available to you on a shared hosting plan, but at the same time don't want to put the money and time to have your very own dedicated server.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Why use a Physical Server?</h2>

            <p>
                Nowadays, everything is being moved to virtual servers. Physical servers are time consuming, and you have to deal with hardware changes, migration issues, and troubleshooting also requires you to be physically present at the location of the machine. However, there are still instances where using a physical server is preferable to using a virtual server. Physical servers are still better for CPU intensive applications because they have dedicateed system resources and won't interfere with other important applications or servers. They are also useful for monitoring virtual hosts (since it is redundant to monitor virtual hosts using virtual servers).
