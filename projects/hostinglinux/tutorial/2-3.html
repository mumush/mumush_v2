			<h2><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Securing SSH</h2>

            <p>
				SSH is the Secure SHell, but it's only as secure as it's configured to be. 
				A recommendation is to disallow password authentication and disable root 
				login. Public key authentication is significantly more secure, and ideally, 
				a combination of public key authentication (with a password-protected key) and password 
				authentication is recommended, making a breaking via SSH essentially impossible without 
				the key of a user who has root permissions.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Securing MySQL</h2>

            <p>
				Do not enable access from anywhere but localhost. MySQL Workbench has this nifty little 
				feature where you can connect to a server via SSH and then connect to a MySQL server, 
				effectively connecting from localhost remotely.

            <h2><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Securing PHP</h2>

            <p>
				Most of PHP is secure by default. A few modifications, like not printing errors, is generally 
				a good idea. The harder it is to find a vector of attack, the better.

						failure counters and limits.
					</p>

					<p>To unlock an account after login failures, run:</p>
			
					<code class="exampleCode">faillog -r -u userName</code>
			
					<p>Note you can use passwd command to lock and unlock accounts:</p>
			
					<code class="exampleCode">
						# lock account<br />
						passwd -l userName<br />
						# unlocak account<br />
						passwd -u userName
					</code>
			
			
				<p class="keyword">Verify no accounts have empty passwords:</p>
