			<h2><i class="fa fa-level-down"></i> Inline CSS</h2>

			<p>
				Inline styles are the most basic way of applying styles to an element, in that you apply 
				the styles directly to the tag in your HTML. This is most useful when you are trying out new tags.
				I could easily try out several styles on several paragraphs to more quickly find the exact look I was going for.
				However, inline styles, while they have a purpose, are not the best way to maintain your Web site.
				When you're working with style sheets, it can sometimes be very difficult to figure out where a style is being set. 
				When you add a mixture of inline, embedded, and external styles and you have even more locations to look.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-level-up"></i> External CSS</h2>

			<p>
				An external style sheet is ideal when the style is applied to many pages. With an external style sheet, you can 
				change the look of an entire Web site by changing one file.  
				The it easier for web developers to make changes on their pages, they do not need to change every single page of 
				the website, instead, they can find the external CSS file and make changes one or couple files. It is more efficient 
				to use external CSS files to build your website.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-adjust"></i> Contrast</h2>

			<p>
				The idea behind contrast is to avoid elements on the page that are merely similar. If the elements (type, color, size, 
				line thickness, shape, space, etc.) are not the same, then make them very different. Contrast is often the most 
				important visual attraction on a page.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-repeat"></i> Repetition</h2>

			<p>
				Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. You can repeat color, shape, texture, spatial 
				relationships, line thicknesses, sizes, etc. This helps develop the organization and strengthens the unity.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-align-center"></i> Alignment</h2>

			<p>
				Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with 
				another element on the page. This creates a clean, sophisticated, fresh took.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-arrows-alt"></i> Proximity</h2>

			<p>
				Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity 
				to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organize 
				information and reduces clutter.
