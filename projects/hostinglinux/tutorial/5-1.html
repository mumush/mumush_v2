			<h2><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download A Killer Editor</h2>

			<p>
				A good text editor will help the developer complete their work more effectively. Text editor is the
				tool to sculpture every single detail of your website. It is not only helpful for building the website,
				but also handy for trouble shooting your code and organize your code. Nowadays, text editors are very
				powerful, choose one the most comfortable you feel to work with.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-code"></i> Always Close Your Tags</h2>

			<p>
				Many people may forget to leave off the closing tags. By today's standards, this is simply bad practice 
				and should be 100% avoided. Always, always close your tags. Otherwise, you'll encounter validation and 
				glitch issues at every turn.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-html5"></i> Organize Your HTML5</h2>

			<p>
				It always makes sense to lay your stylesheet out in a way that allows you to quickly find parts of your code. I 
				recommend a top-down format that tackles styles as they appear in the source code.  See the following 
				<a class="sectionLink" href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/30-css-best-practices-for-beginners/">link</a> 
				for more information on HTML/CSS structure.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-archive"></i> Containers</h2>

			<p>
				Use a div tag to wrap your content appropriately. It is better to have control of your content as well 
				as flexible to your design. Additionally, don't forget to add an ID or a class to your wrapper.  It's the 
				best practice to use most of <a class="sectionLink" href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/30-html-best-practices-for-beginners/">these</a>
				tags.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-comment"></i> Always Comment your Code</h2>
		
			<p>
				HTML files can become quite extensive, spanning hundreds of lines. These large files can make finding and editing 
				code nearly impossible. Use comments to build a table of contents at the top of your file, as well as outline blocks 
				of code throughout the file. Doing so tells others exactly what is contained within the file, whereabout the styles 
				are located, and exactly what a specific style pertains to.  Find more information regarding effective commenting

			<h2><i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> Forms</h2>

			<p>
				HTML forms are important components of modern websites. Itâ€™s how your customers tell you who they are, sign up for 
				services and purchase your products. They are the major way your users communicate with you.  If you are truly interacting 
				with your web site's users you will need to gather some information about them at some point and most of the time this 
				is done through a <a class="sectionLink" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/steampowered/2011/10/why-html-forms-are-still-important.html">form</a>.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Always Validate</h2>

			<p>
				Learning to validate your HTML is an important step for most designers. By writing 
				<a class="sectionLink" href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/validating-code/">valid</a> HTML you ensure that your 
				pages are standards compliant and will run on the most user agents and web browsers. It's no different than comparing 
				a sentence you write to the rules of grammar for the language you wrote it in. In fact the grammar analogy is a good 
				one to keep in mind when you think of validating your code.
