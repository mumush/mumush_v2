			<h2><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What is SSH?</h2>

            <p>
				SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure 
				data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, 
				and other secure network services between two networked computers that 
				connects, via a secure channel over an insecure network, a server and a 
				client (running SSH server and SSH client programs, respectively).

			<h2><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> Advantages of SSH</h2>

			<p>
				SSH provides encryption for data transfer that prevents would-be attackers 
				from accessing your password and user information.  For this reason, another 
				advantage of SSH is that you can use it to tunnel other protocols.  For example, 
				if you want to transfer files securely, you can use SSH to encrypt your FTP transfers.  
				You can do this with just about any type of connection, such as VNC or Samba.
