			<h2><i class="fa fa-code"></i> Intro to Server Side Languages</h2>

			<p>
				Although briefly mentioned above, server side scripting languages are where the real logic in a web applications occur.  The most popular languages in web development are PHP, Ruby, and Python, to name a few.  More information on each of these can be found further in this section.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scripting languages are used to interact with the server, as noted in the name of this section.  The languages can be used to make connections with, query, and get data from the selected database tables in order to populate sections of the html markup.  The way this is accomplished, is through the use of variables in the scripting languages which contain rows of data returned from database queries, which can then be iterated through via the scripting language and then returned out into the html which can then be seen by the end user upon a page reload.  The advantage of these languages are many, but the fact that their syntax can be embedded inside existing html is one huge benefit to web developers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course this is much easier said than done, which is why many developers have created frameworks which result in the separation of concerns, a common technique used in designing and implementing software in which the database work, business logic, and actual GUI the user sees, is separated in a such a way that the communication between each of these "concerns" can be achieved in a much more organized fashion.  Examples of these frameworks are <a class="sectionLink" href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">Codeigniter</a> and <a class="sectionLink" href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, which are two widely used framworks that implement PHP as their scripting languages.  <a class="sectionLink" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> is a framework that uses Python to do the server side scripting and is actually used in today's favorite image filtering web application, Instagram.  <a class="sectionLink" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is yet another framework, but it implements the scripting language known as Ruby.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from using these frameworks, scripting languages are extremely powerful, and listed below are three that we would recommend for your web application if you are interested in making your website quite dynamic.

			<h2>PHP</h2>

			<p>
				PHP code is interpreted by the PHP processor module, which is done on the server, and then generates the resulting web page it is embedded in, and send that back to the users machine.  For information regarding the implementation of PHP by itself, and the resulting syntax of the standalone web scripting language, see the following <a class="sectionLink" href="http://us.php.net/" target="_blank">link</a>.  If you are interested in seeing the implementation of PHP in web frameworks, see the following links: <a class="sectionLink" href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a>, <a class="sectionLink" href="http://cakephp.org/" target="_blank">CakePHP</a>

			<h2>Python</h2>

			<p>
				It is also possible to use Python to build web applications and dynamic websites. There are a few ways to do so. Perhaps the simplest is to install <a class="sectionLink" href="http://modpython.org/">mod_python</a> for Apache, which will embed the Python interpreter into Apache and allow you to build Python applications. For greater details about mod_python, read <a class="sectionLink" href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/10/02/mod_python.html">this article</a>.
			</p>
			<p> 
				For larger Python projects, you may wish to use a framework. One of the more popular Python frameworks is called Django. For information regarding the use of the Django framework, see <a class="sectionLink" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">their website</a>.

			<h2>Ruby</h2>

			<p>
				Ruby is a programming language that is similar to PHP in a few ways. The Ruby on Rails framework is an easy way to work with the language in a web environment. Just like PHP, using Ruby on Rails is as simple as intalling mod_rails to Apache, and you're ready to start building a site with Ruby! If you're interested in getting started with Ruby on Rails, check out <a class="sectionLink" href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html" target="_blank">this guide</a>.
