			<h2><i class="fa fa-random"></i> FTP</h2>

            <p>
				FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol". It is an Internet service specially 
				designed to establish a connection to a particular Internet server (or computer), 
				so that users are able to transfer files (download) to their computer or to transfer 
				(upload) their own files to the server (computer). The FTP protocol also includes 
				commands that can be used to execute operations on a remote computer; e.g., to show 
				folder contents, change directories, create folders or delete files.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Risks of FTP</h2>

			<p>
				Using the FTP protocol is regarded to be very unsafe because a password must always be 
				entered for the transfer. The password is subsequently transmitted over the Internet 
				without encryption. Despite the fact that FTP is one of the oldest and most widely used 
				Internet protocols, there are security risks when using it.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> SFTP</h2>

            <p>
				SFTP stands for "Secure File Transfer Protocol". The Secure File Transfer Protocol ensures 
				that data are securely transferred using a private and safe data stream. It is the standard 
				data transmission protocol for use with the SSH2 protocol. The SFTP protocol's main purpose 
				is to transfer data, but it is also used to obtain general access to the FTP server's file system. 
				The SFTP protocol runs on a secure channel - no clear text passwords or file data are transferred.

			<h2><i class="fa fa-folder"></i> Directory Structure</h2>

			<p>
				When creating you site directory, it is helpful to to structure your directory in an organized way.
				A commonly used practice is having an 'assets' folder in your main directory. In this assets folder you 
				will store things like css pages or other even other folders for things like images and other media.
				It is also a good idea to have separate folders for different types of content. For example; making a folder
				named /js and storing all your javascript content within the folder. 
				Structuring a site directory in this way can help organize all your content and help you keep track of where every part of your site is, especially with larger sites.
