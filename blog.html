			<h2 class="postTitle">Context Awareness<span class="postDate">July 27, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I've been doing a lot of ideation lately, and one of the biggest findings was that the Watch can be context aware of what is happening in the mobile companion app.  <span class="postImportantText">The Watch becomes extremely useful as a context aware reference point for information that would be too bothersome to take your phone out and get yourself</span>.  Instead, the Watch surfaces it for you.
				</p>

				<p>
					Think about a scenario in which you're looking at your phone to check the bus schedule.  You then lock your phone, and continue to walk towards the bus stop.  As you raise your wrist to glance at the time, you press the Digital Crown, which then takes you not to the home screen, but instead immediately to the companion bus watch app.  It shows you only the most important information &mdash; the time the bus you were just looking at in the mobile app is going to arrive, and whether or not it's early or late.
				</p>

				<p>
					We can extend the bus example further to touch on the benefits of time-sensitive notifications:  I usually start to walk to the bus stop around 6:30, in order to catch the bus by 7:00, but its arrival time fluctuates.  So how do I know if the bus is early, on-time, or late?  Well, I open the app to find out.  But what if the app merely sent you a notification saying "Hey dude, hurry up!  Your bus is early and will be here in 9 minutes."  <span class="postImportantText">The beauty here is that you as the user didn't have to go out and get that crucial information, it instead came to you through a tap on the wrist,</span> and it could be the difference between you waiting another hour for the next bus in a sour mood.
				</p>

				<p>
					It seems like this context, or flow aware, use case of the Watch can have huge implications on how we access data, and even more so, how that data can come to us on the raise of our wrist.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Lift v1 Update<span class="postDate">July 26, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					In the spirit of coming up with one-word names, I landed on Lift for my workout Watch app.  As I mentioned a few days ago, not being able to use it in the real world has been super annoying because the whole point of this app is to make my life in the gym easier when it comes to checking what exercise I have next, or how many sets I have to go.  Regardless, I just finished the first iteration and I'm eager to find a way to get it on my Watch, whether that means doing some hacky Xcode trick or not.  Here's two shots of the app in the simulator, but I'm expecting both size and spacing to change once I see how things feel on device.
				</p>

				<div class="postCompareFigures">
					<figure class="postFigure" style="margin: 0 1em">
						<img class="" src="img/blog_images/liftv1_above.png" alt="Lift v1 Above Bezel">
						<figcaption class="postFigCaption">Above the Bezel</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<figure class="postFigure" style="margin: 0 1em">
						<img class="" src="img/blog_images/liftv1_below.png" alt="Lift v1 Below Bezel">
						<figcaption class="postFigCaption">Below the Bezel</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>

				<p>
					Originally, I wanted to have a table with each muscle group (chest, legs, etc.), and then upon tapping one, you'd be taken to a page-based navigation view that allowed you to swipe through each of the exercises in order (which is why page-based navigation made sense), as well as showing the rep/set count respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I mentioned a few days ago, finding out that you can't mix the two of these navigation schemes led me back to Sketch, in which I eventually landed on the above screenshot.  This was sort of a blessing in disguise, as I had thought the list of muscles would be a little bit bland, so taking this page-based approach provided the opportunity for a big visual.  As you scroll the page down, you are then presented with a list of muscle specific exercises along with their rep/set counts.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was initially concerned that page-based navigation wouldn't make sense in this format, however it does.  The reason for that, is because I work on the same muscle group every Monday &mdash; my chest, which is the first page in the navigation.  Because I do the first page (chest) on Monday, and the second page (back) on Tuesday, this sequential mapping of muscles and days of the week makes a lot of sense.  The list of exercises is quite close to what you see in the Weather app as you scroll down, however I'm thinking that when I end up using the app in the gym, I'll find that the list styling needs to be tweaked.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I press on to make the icon, I'm thinking about looking into the other watchOS2 API's especially what's available in HealthKit.  It'll be interesting to look into what cool stuff you can do with heartrate.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Watch Hierarchy<span class="postDate">July 24, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					As I've been going through the design process for my Watch apps, both in and outside of work, I find that there is one common question that I keep coming back to: "What's the most important information to the user?"  It seems obvious now that I type it out, but I can't believe how much time I've spent thinking about what content should be placed "above the bezel (fold)," and how that content is hierarchically different from other content on the screen.  Content really is king on the Watch.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I first started to work with notifications, which seem like a gimmick until you actually live with them (they're great), I used the Calendar's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/watch/human-interface-guidelines/app-components/" target="_blank">Long Look Notification</a> as a template for text-based hierarchy.  It does a great job of using color, weight, size, and space to define hierarchy, whilst also ensuring only the most important text is displayed.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's been really interesting, spending time thinking about the correct balance between type size, weight, color, and space.  <span class="postImportantText">The watch's dimensions are such a good constraint that they force you to choose your words carefully</span> &mdash; yet another thing that I took for granted prior to starting to work with the Watch.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Watch OS Beta Issues<span class="postDate">July 22, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					In order to take advantage of the newest functionality available in the next version of watchOS, I really want to get the watchOS2 beta installed on my Watch so that I can build my apps to my Apple Watch rather than the Watch Simulator.  Early on it's okay to use the Simulator to test functionality, but once you get into the visuals component and font sizes you really need to see things on the real thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been unable to successfully build a watch app to my own Apple Watch both at home, and in work &mdash; which is super frustrating because I really need to see how things look on device.  Every time I attempt to build and run the app, I either get a spinning progress black screen for 10+ minutes, or the app launches and immediately crashes.  Apparently I'm not alone on this, so I guess that makes me feel a bit better, but it's extremely inconvenient because I really want to use my workout app in the gym!
				</p>
				<p>
					If I find a solution I'll definitely post about it, but for now I'll just have to deal with running in the Simulator.  I haven't made a ton of progress on my workout app as I've been quite busy in work, but I'm thinking I'll be done with it this weekend so that I can post some screenshots.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Building the Watch App<span class="postDate">July 21, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I've never been an early adopter of devices, especially devices that you can build apps for, so this experience was very new, yet super cool for me.  Digging into the documentation as well as some tutorials I found that the development process was much, much simpler than building an iOS app.  It's crazy that there are so many limitations to what you can do on the Watch, but I totally understand why.
				</p>
				<p>
					After mocking up the app in Sketch, my original thought was to have a list with each body part (chest, back, legs, etc.), and tapping on any of those list items would take you to a page-based view that allowed you to swipe through each of the exercises and see the name as well as the set/rep count.  After trying to make it happen, I was stunned to find out that navigation can be either page-based, or hierarchical &mdash; one or the other, not both.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course that sent me back to the drawing board, at which point I landed on a pattern similar to that of the Weather app, where page-based navigation is used.  Except in this instance the name of the body part as well as a glyph of it is displayed above the fold, and when you scroll down you see a list of the exercises along with set/rep counts.  I'll post an image of what I have soon!

			<h2 class="postTitle">Watch & Gym<span class="postDate">July 20, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Being immersed in the Watch world is tough because I really wanted to find a novel use case that could make a watch app better than than the companion iPhone app.  But I realized that the Watch isn't here to take down the phone, it's here to work in tandem with it, and I found this out first hand at the gym a few days ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					Briefly, my process at the gym is to workout with music playing on my phone, and also have a website up in Safari that shows what exercises to do on which days.  In a normal gym session, I'll choose one of my current favorite songs, lock my phone, and continue working out.  As I finish a set of the current exercise, and pay close attention to these steps: <span class="postImportantText">I go into my pocket and grab my phone, hit the home/wake button, slide to unlock it/enter my password if touch id isn't working, hit the home button to jump out of the music app, switch into Safari, and then look at what exercise I have next</span>.  From there I'll likely choose a new song in the Music app, and thus the cycle continues.  But what's wrong with this?
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, it's annoying.  It's something that always bugged me because I hated have to always toggle between those two apps.  It's important to note here how minor of an inconvenience this is.  The existing interaction is requiring me to do a bit more work on my phone.  But the process quickly becomes rote, and stale as I go to the gym every day.  This is where the Watch comes in.
				</p>
				<p>
					I realized that it would be awesome if I had a Watch app that simply showed me what exercises I had each day &mdash; exactly what the website did, but this time on my wrist.  The funny part about this is that it's so hard to pitch the benefits until you actually live through the pain points, so I'm really happy that I did.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Using Apple Watch<span class="postDate">July 19, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Before making any blind design decisions, I thought it would be a good idea (and a good excuse) to purchase an Apple Watch in order to get a deeper understanding of the overall experience.  I've been using the Watch for close to 3 weeks now, and it's been an interesting ride.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first day I wore it to work, in the real world, I had quite a few exciting moments that really made me appreciate parts of the experience.  The use of haptics along with the Taptic Engine feels phenominal &mdash; it's genuinely unlike anything I have ever experienced, and made receiving notifications just feel really pleasant.  But aside from notifications, I honestly had a "So now what?" type of feeling because I really couldn't figure out how the Watch was more useful than my phone.  This is the root of all unrealistic conceptions of the Watch &mdash; and the reason why no one think it's useful.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the iPad was first revealed, I scoffed at it: "Why would you get an iPad when you can just use your phone or laptop?"  The thing is, the iPad <span class="postImportantText">isn't your iPhone, and it's not your laptop either</span>.  It's a niche product that makes for a better experience purely due to convenience &mdash; the Watch is in the exact same boat, but has much higher aspirations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Getting past the reality that it's not a phone, and doesn't embody nearly the amount of functionality or screen real estate is super important.  It's a watch.  It needs to be small and unobtrusive.  So what can you put on a screen that small?  Only the most important content.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think the Weather app is the best example of what a Watch app should aspire to be.  It immediately shows a rich visual with the most important information &mdash; the temperature right now.  As you scroll down you're able to see hourly temperatures as well as highs and lows.  This was a great example of hierarchy in a Watch app.  The app also uses page based navigation, which allows users to swipe left and right in a sequential manner rather than a hierarchical drill down that most smartphone users are accustomed to.  To me, the page-based navigation seems to work better as it feels super smooth, and doesn't require you to tap the back button that you would deal with in a hierarchical navigation.  This is great because the touch targets on the watch are very small, so fat-fingering is a real issue.

					During my internship, I've been able to explore the applications of the smartwatch, and the pain points that it can potentially remedy.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Leveraging Z-Space<span class="postDate">May 4, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Our devices are two-dimensional, but the interface displayed on these screens doesn't have to be.  Almost every interface designed for mobile and web apps uses two dimesions, in which the pieces of the interface appear to be neatly layed on top of the screen.  Why?
				</p>
				<p>
					On the desktop, OS X in particular, depth is used to effectively present a layered interface in which different windows of content can be hierarchically presented above one another, which decreases the gap between real world interactions, and those done through a screen &mdash; it makes the interface feel more realistic because it's more than just a picture frame.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you've ever launched Time Machine on OS X, you'll remember the three-dimensional timeline that you can navigate through to access a backup from way back when.  The first time I saw that, I was absolutely blown away, and frankly kind of scared (which is something to be said about these sorts of interfaces), by the way that I was able to actually move <span class="postImportantText">through</span> the interface rather than simply act <span class="postImportantText">on it</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interfaces that effectively use depth make an in-app experience on a phone or web browser feel more like an entrance into a new "space," rather than a new picture in the same frame.  The former creates a sense of immersion that all mobile and web applications seek, which inevitably create a beautifully addicting application.

			<h2 class="postTitle">HTML5 API's<span class="postDate">March 9, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Tech talks are awesome.  I've always found inspiration to try something new in the many talks I've watched on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>.  After watching a few talks from UDE Boston, I came across two in particular that really sparked my interest.  The first was a talk by Tim Wright regarding some <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/10-html5-apis-worth-looking/" target="_blank">HTML5 API's</a>.  The second was probably the funniest informative talk I've ever seen, courtesy of Steve Marx, which was about playing with third-party API's.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both of these talks did what I feel all talks should, inspire.  Wright's talk completly opened my eyes to the HTML5 API's that I had somehow never heard of.  I'll openly admit I was late to the game on these.  Featuring a Network Information, Geo Location, User Media, and WebSocket API &mdash;  and that's just naming a few of my favorites.  I'm still trying to figure out how I slept on these.  I might have to put my Whether app on hold for a few days this week just to explore what's possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Marx's talk was hilarious &mdash; but hilariously informative.  Of his seven demos, one was a web app that set up a webhook to play the ESPN song "dadada" on his laptop whenever he pushed to Github.  It sounds kind of quirky and not really useful, but it proves to be a great example of pushing the boundaries of what can be done via third-party API's.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm definitely planning on digging deeper into webhooks, sockets, and especially the newish HTML5 API's.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Motivate<span class="postDate">March 8, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					School work has kept me super busy lately, especially with my Human Centered Requirements & Design class.  I've been heavily invested in our semester long project that requires teams to build one highly usable application on any platform.  I'm really excited about where our app stands right now, despite the fact that we've started coding, or high fidelity design yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our app, that we just recently renamed to "Motivate," was originally slated to make it easy to log food/nutrition information for those who are trying to lose/gain weight, or those who are recovering/recovered from an eating disorder.  Our idea was relatively simple, and had been done before.
				</p>
				<p>
					This past weekend, we realized that many existing diet tracking apps fail to do one massively important thing when it comes to dieting effectively: motivate their users to continue toward their goal weight.  Our project aims to capitalize on this through the use of visual comparitive motivation.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a lot of research, we learned that the best way to motivate someone who for example, is trying to get thinner, is through comparitive imagery.  This however does not apply for those who have had, or are recovering from an eating disorder.  Below I'll list some of the ideas we generated, feasible or not.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the "dashboard" view of our app, where you see how close you are to your dietary goals for the day, there is always a different image in the header that features someone who you physically aspire to look like.  Every week, the app asks you to take a picture of yourself.  Every Friday, the app says something like, "Hey, you're doing great.  This is what you looked like last week..."  Upon opening the notification, you see the selfie that you took last week.  Around twice a week, once you've met your goal for the day, you send a motivational message (which doesn't require you to add any text and is anonymous) to another user who has not yet achieved their goal, but is visually further along in the process of reaching their goal weight.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mixing all of these interesting motivational approaches could prove to be <span class="postImportantText">extremely effective in helping users stay dedicated to their diet</span>.  Based on our interviews, we found that users often lose motivation to continue with their diet after some time because they don't see any visual changes quick enough.  We feel the motivational concepts mentioned above could help, and I'm interested to see how effective the app really is.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Redesign.<span class="postDate">March 1, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					As I continue to build more, I've come to realize that a simple list of project names just isn't enough for my portfolio.  Yes, it's super minimal, but the minimalism is actually taking away from the effectiveness of the portfolio.  This is because the project names aren't descriptive enough.  This weekend I changed that.
				</p>

				<figure class="postFigure">
					<img class="postImgWithShadow postImgLarge" src="img/blog_images/portfolio_v1.png" alt="Portfolio v1">
					<figcaption class="postFigCaption">Old Portfolio Design</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					Looking at the old portfolio above, you can see the simple list of projects by name, which are not nearly descriptive enough.  As my projects started to move into different fronts I tried to use parentheses to help identify which type of tech I used, but these were only a temporary solution to a problem that still hadn't been solved.  The description of what the project achieved was actually more important.
				</p>

				<figure class="postFigure">
					<img class="postImgWithShadow postImgLarge" src="img/blog_images/portfolio_v2.png" alt="Portfolio v2">
					<figcaption class="postFigCaption">New Portfolio Design</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					In the new design, I took the idea of the project description being the most important, and made it the focal point for each project.  Utilizing font size and weight, the eye is instantly drawn there.  If the project sparks the readers interest, a hierarchically secondary link is supplied directly beneath the description.  The text in the link is succinct and includes the project name.  Using two elements like this keeps things looking very minimal, but also quite interesting.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although it's not shown in the above image, it's worth mentioning that in the new portfolio I also included an about section which doubles as a greeting in the header.  I realized that the old design didn't say enough about me, so adding a little something about what drives me helps make the experience a little bit more personal.
				</p>

				<figure class="postFigure">
					<img class="postImgWithShadow postImgLarge" src="img/blog_images/blog_v1.png" alt="Blog v1">
					<figcaption class="postFigCaption">Old Blog Design</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					Now looking at the old blog you'll notice I carried the same transparent style used in the original portfolio for consistency.  This most definitely took away from the readability of the posts as well as the thin and small type.  I knew this, but felt it was a worthy tradeoff as long as I kept the posts background opacity reasonably close to a pure white.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the design that you're currently using, you can likely tell the goal was readability.  Using a larger serif font was just one of the steps taken to make reading each post easier on the eyes.  Constricting post-width such that line length didn't tire the eyes, and increasing line height also prevented mid-sentence line skips.
				</p>
				<p>
					Utilizing white space to effectively separate posts made bordering each post a nonissue, which also aids in the minimal design that I wanted to carry over from the portfolio.  On that same note, each post's title text is a darker hue of the color used in the bio section of the portfolio.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fixing the location of the link back to my portfolio (in the top left), regardless of how far you've scrolled down, makes it easy to navigate back to "home base" at all times and properly utilizes available white space.  Making the text color closer to the white background makes it less eye-catching, but visible when you've started to scroll down.
				</p>
				<p>
					I dig this look, and am excited to post more about my "what to wear" project that I've renamed to "Whether."  It was long overdue.

				<p>
					If you're curious why I picked these weather instances, <a href="https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2" target="_blank">Forecast's docs</a> outline a total of 13 different icons that you can expect to get as strings when you access the API.  They also recommend including a "default" icon in case the API returns a string that you have not yet accounted for &mdash; this is likely to happen if a new icon is added for a different instance like "tsunami."
				</p>
				<p>
					After moving each of these over to my existing Xcode project and viewing them on my device, I'm super happy with how they came out.  It feels good to further close the gap between being able to both develop, and design.  I can't say these are "final" because I know I'm going to keep trying out new things in Sketch, but for now, I really like them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it's time to make that background change depending on the temperature and a nice little animation from the last temp's number to the current number.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Weather Glyph Update<span class="postDate">February 25, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I'm making pretty good progress with the first round of weather glyphs!  Forecast gives you an "icon" dictionary that could have one of 12 different values like "partly-cloudy-day" or "sleet" which is super convenient, so I've been working on glyphs for each of those possible states.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was on a serious roll but at some point got stuck on a layering issue that I didn't entirely understand &mdash; I guess that's sort of expected considering I don't have a ton of experience creating glyphs.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wanted to have the outline of part of the sun shown behind the outline of a cloud, but every time I tried, I ended up with a cloud showing the bottom half of the sun...ugh.  The solution was a mixture of a few things.  I first had to take the existing cloud and sun, and align them just right (this would result in the bottom of the sun being visible inside the cloud).  I then made sure the cloud layer was on top of the sun (ensuring the subtraction would work correctly), and then duplicated the cloud layer.  I then subtracted the cloud layer from the sun layer, yielding a piece of the sun, and the remaining portion of the duplicated cloud in front of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not quite sure if this is the correct approach, but it did the trick for me!

I'd love to contribute them to the <a href="http://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">Noun Project</a>, which has truly been invaluable throughout my design process.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm using CoreLocation to get the coordinates of the users current location and then sending those coordinates to a call to the <a href="http://forecast.io/" target="_blank">Forecast.io</a> API to get the weather.  I can definitely thank <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> for opening my eyes to Forecast.  It's about time I made use of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the screenshot below, it's pretty clear what I'm trying to do &mdash; help you choose what to wear based on the weather!  It's something that I wish I had back in freshmen year when I used to wear shorts to class in less than 10 degree weather.  The target audience is college students who will likely be outside walking to and from class, or someone who plans to spend a lot of time outside in a given day.
				</p>

				<figure class="postFigure">
					<img class="postImgWithShadow" src="img/blog_images/whattowear1.png" alt="What To Wear Screenshot">
				</figure>

				<p>
					As far as design choices go, I primarily wanted to make the app fun (as always) but also informative, not forgetting to keep things minimal.  My original mockups didn't contain the lines or labels for each article of clothing.  My original thought was to present the clothing icons in a 2 column grid, but it was an approach that an existing app took that I didn't really love &mdash; it just felt sort of bare.  At some point later in the day I came across a blueprint of an <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/105060603781381543/" target="_blank">X-Wing</a> (a ship from Star Wars) on Pinterest, and now that I'm typing this out, I think that's where I got the idea of bringing a sort of "blueprint" feel to the design.  It helps to create some separation between the temperature and the recommended clothes to wear and I think the lines guide the eye from the label to the icon which feels explicit.
				</p>
				<p>
					This week I'll likely spend a lot of time working on the weather icons, but I'm definitely going to try to fit in some coding if I think of a cool interaction idea.  I want to get better at creating glyphs in Sketch, so this will be good practice.

				<p>
					So I looked into existing apps, and found that a developer made a similar app, but didn't show the user what they should wear later on in the day.  Many of the reviews read something like: "...but it only tells you what you're wearing right now.  I wake up every day at 5:30, so it always tells me to wear a jacket, shirt and jeans!"
				</p>
				<p>
					Given this finding, I'm thinking a vertical scroll view containig three different views, each representing a time later in the day/night.  Each view takes up the height and width of the device.  If it's 5:30 in the morning, the first view would be what to wear right now (showing the screenshot above), as you scroll down, the next would be this afternoon, and then tonight.  I'm not sure how this would look on a device, but at the moment creating a view of what to wear right now is the first priority.
				</p>
				<p>
					  I also found that the existing app accounts for both mens and womens clothes in the glyphs.  I had considered this as a potential adoption issue, and it's something that I'll have to address.  Food for thought.

			<h2 class="postTitle">What To Wear Project<span class="postDate">February 20, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					With the iOS app challenge influencing a lot of my thoughts (the photography idea below), I've been in what I'll call a problem-solving rut.  Lately I've had a difficult time asking myself "why" about a lot of things, which is what I normally do to generate new ideas.  Finally, I've started developing a new iOS project that I'm calling <span class="postImportantText">What To Wear</span> &mdash; I'll think of a cooler name soon enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been trying to get as much inspiration as I can from the outdoors, but Pinterest and Dribble can't hurt.  The app is going to be relatively simple but help solve a common problem for me as well as a lot of other students I've talked to.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've looked into similar apps that are going for the same idea, and have noted pain points that I can improve upon in my own implementation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just like I did with my last iOS project, <span class="postImportantText">I'll be documenting my progress on here all the way through</span>.  I'm going to be a little less "to the chest" with this project, and once I have something working, I'll post screenshots and gifs to show my progress.  I created quite a few mid-fidelity mock ups but won't post them until I choose a solid design direction that makes the user experience as effective as possible in solving the problem.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Taking Better Photos<span class="postDate">February 9, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Over the past few years we've seen a consistent increase in the amount of filtering and post processing in camera-leveraging apps, especially in iOS.  Let's be honest, the manipulations to the images are more often than not really interesting and quite beatiful, but all of these filtered images lack something.
				</p>
				<p>
					We as the image takers are getting stuck in this vortex of just being "the image takers."  <span class="postImportantText">Filtering and post-processing are preventing us from becoming better photographers.</span>  General users of camera apps aren't able to take photographs with artistic meaning, and to paraphrase a few articles I've read, "they all require an accompanying description."  Wouldn't it be cool if the average joe could take meaningful pictures?  I think so.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm working with the idea of creating a camera app that can actually help its users understand the important pieces of photography in order to help them think a bit more about the shots they take rather than the generic "point and shoot" that we've all become so accustomed to.  I'm not just talking about photography mechanics like exposure, ISO, shutter speed, or white balance; although those will definitely be important in the experience.  I'm also talking about showing users to explore other angles and perspectives through the apps experience.  The point of the project is to see if I can develop an experience that helps the average (non photographer) take more meaningful images.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's a tall order, but I'm trying to talk to as many photography friends as I can to understand the art such that I can build an effective experience.

			<h2 class="postTitle">A Chrome Extension<span class="postDate">February 3, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Just as I was starting to get into the swing of things back at school, I stumbled upon a problem in Chrome that I hadn't yet solved.  Every time I think I'll "read a page later," I pin it to the tab bar in Chrome.  More often than not, I'll wind up with 10+ pinned tabs, none of which I can see the title for.  A few days ago I saw a guy who legitimately had half of the tab bar full of pinned tabs, so I knew it wasn't alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					A bit after this realization, I noticed how I use Chrome's "New Tab" page to click some websites I don't have pinned tabs for, but visit often.  I've seen quite a few Chrome Extensions that do a lot with the page, and look beautiful &mdash; but they take slightly too long to load.  It really is just another HTML file.  Given the fact that most users create a new tab to then type in a url <i>or</i> do a direct search on Google, the time spent on the New Tab page is often quite small.  Because of this, waiting for content to load is not an option.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided to make a Chrome Extension that allows you to "pin a tab" to the New Tab page.  It's achieved through the use of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction" target="_blank">a browser action button</a>.  Upon clicking the button on a tab that you would normally just pin to read later, nothing changes on your tab bar.  Instead, a screenshot, the page title, and the url are taken from the tab and are saved to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage" target="_blank">chrome.storage</a> behind the scenes.  Now, when you open a new tab you'll see something like this:
				</p>

				<figure class="postFigure">
					<img class="postImgWithShadow postImgLarge" src="img/blog_images/readtablater.png" alt="ReadTabLater Extension">
					<figcaption class="postFigCaption">Read Tab Later: Chrome Extension</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					You'll notice that the pages you would have normally just pinned to read later, now appear on the new tab page similar to Chrome's existing new tab page.  Upon clicking one of the screenshot images, you're taken to the page you were planning on reading later.  As you would assume, when you hover over one of the images, an "x" appears just like the default new tab page in Chrome.  This was all on purpose.  <span class="postImportantText">The goal was to make this extension feel like it was built into Chrome by default.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the top right of Chrome you'll notice this extensions' browser icon to the right of the address bar.  Due to this screenshots quality, it's tough to see that the icon presents a "pin" inside of a tab that is pinned to the tab bar.  Again, the goal here was to make everything look like it was a part of Chrome by default, so that is where the icon inspiration came from.
				</p>
				<p>
					The name of the extension is relatively straight forward, which is actually quite the opposite of the way I usually name my projects: Read Tab Later.  You can find the extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-tab-later/cmnjlnadoijdhgkcglfejbinjobgmbhn" target="_blank">here in the Chrome Web Store</a>.  I'm hoping this extension proves to be useful for others who find their tab bars equally as cluttered as mine used to be!

			<h2 class="postTitle">A Future Without Apps<span class="postDate">January 14, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

			<p>
				Recently I've been doing a lot of thinking about apps, and their role in future systems like mobile phones.  I had this thought that there may not even be a need for stand alone apps, so I figured I'd try to expand on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a day that involves some waiting, I'll pull out my phone and check Pinterest.  After I've scrolled down long enough, I move on to Medium and look for some interesting tech/design articles.  I don't have the Facebook or Twitter apps on my phone, but we can assume that a large number of users go to these apps at some point during their waiting period.  My dad uses a few different news apps as well as a third-party weather app.  Let's not forget Instagram, Yik Yak, Tinder, Vine...the list could go on and on depending on the user.  In the majority of these apps, users are consuming content to pass time.
			</p>
			<p>
				What if our mobile devices didn't need to install a standalone app, and only needed to make a behind the scenes request to a [web] service in order to gather content?  What if that connection was made as soon as you woke up your device?  Once that connection was made, your device would then display content that was most relevant to what you wanted, or needed without opening anything &mdash; it was just there.
			</p>
			<p>
				This idea was generated from an iOS app I used called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ping/id922669797?mt=8" target="_blank">Ping</a>, which has the goal of giving you the content you want so you don't need to search for it.  Think about that statement.  That's what we should be pushing for.  <span class="postImportantText">How can we give our users the content they want before they hear about it?</span>  Ping does this by sending you a push notification, which isn't the ideal experience if you're familiar with the way push notifications work from a programmatic standpoint, but it gets pretty damn close to providing content without needing to open an app at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few months ago Github announced its <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">Student Developer Pack</a>, which made relatively expensive services available to students through a number of huge discounts.  This was a <span class="postImportantText">huge deal</span>.  Some of the discounts were crazy &mdash; I don't have to pay for my web hosting for a year.  That crazy.  As soon as this was announced, I got a push notification from Ping giving me the low down.  I mean how sweet is that?  I had to do absolutely nothing, and got a massive reward for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think the future of content consumption and the resulting interfaces lie in the mechanics of this app, and it's something I'd love to work on.

			<h2 class="postTitle">A New Year Update<span class="postDate">January 11, 2015</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

			<p>
				This break has been filled with a lot of friends, and even more sleep.  Last week I had my wisdom teeth taken out, so staying awake has been a serious struggle for me, believe it or not.  In the hours that I am awake, I've been working on the design of Localhost's website, myself and <a href="http://joshvickerson.com/" target="_blank">Josh's</a> club at RIT.  The club is a tool for students to stay up to date with current tech, whether that tech be programming languages like Swift, or frameworks like Ember.  Students can then present a technlogy to the club to hopefully generate incentive among members to build something new.  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mu058qy3u55moe0/v8.png?dl=0" target="_blank">Here's a look at one of the earlier iterations.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Although I had a head of steam with the hair cut app idea a few weeks ago, I really don't want to let go of my group listening app idea.  I've been doing a lot of research regarding streaming audio with iOS and I am fairly positive this is the app I will build next.
			</p>
			<p>
				Per usual, I've been on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> nonstop.  I took a course on Typography to learn more about the importance and facets of type, and a few more courses on Swift concepts which I can't get enough of.  Through learning Swift I'm finding that I'm having a much easier time reading Objective-C code, so I think I'm going to take a couple more courses on developing with Objective-C to strengthen my knowledge of lower level concepts.  Treehouse has been invaluable in my progression as a programmer and designer.
			</p>
			<p>
				On Friday I downloaded <a href="http://elevateapp.com/" target="_blank">Elevate</a>, an app for "brain training" very similar to Lumosity, and love the games.  It's hard to not make it part of my morning routine during break.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I mentioned a while ago, I want to submit a theme I named "Moosh" to the Cydia store for jailbreakers to rock, and I'm continuing to make more icons for it.  It's just as fun as I expected.  Here's the maps icon and a music icon which wouldn't be part of the theme, but I thought it was a cool twist!

			<h2 class="postTitle">A Haircut App<span class="postDate">December 23, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Yesterday my dad pitched an app idea for haircuts.  Today I tried to pick his brain about it so that I could morph the idea into something awesome.  An hour later I left the kitchen, went to my room, opened up Sketch, and immediately wireframed my new ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					The app will make finding a <span class="postImportantText">reliable</span> salon or barbershop super simple.  It'll do this by removing the "trial and error" aspect from finding the right place to get your hair cut when you're in an unfamiliar area.
				</p>
				<p>
					Believe what you want, but your hair says a lot about who you are, and that's why the process needs to be made less of a "hail mary."  I'm really excited about this idea, and I'll be sure to post as much as I can during the journey.  Oh yea &mdash; once I wireframed, I had to have some fun and draw up a few icons.  Here's one of them.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Location Value in Apple Pay<span class="postDate">December 22, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Up until today, I wasn't quite sure of the value in Apple Pay.  After a phone call with my dad about an idea for a haircut app, I now realize how powerful Apple Pay could be in using purchase location to generate <span class="postImportantText">recommendations</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In its <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203027" target="_blank">security and privacy overview</a>, Apple mentions that if you have Location Services turned on, location based data <i>may</i> be sent to Apple after you make a purchase with Apple Pay.
				</p>
				<p>
					Okay, imagine an instance in which you go to a new state and aren't familiar with any of the restaurants, but you like a specific type of food that you often get at your favorite restaurant back home.  Normally you'd use an app like Yelp to get recommendations based on your location.  With Apple Pay, and without the need for an app, your phone could likely recommend a place similar to the one you loved back at home.  Your phone would know your favorite restaurant based on your purchasing habits and could then recommend other locations.  There's no need for an app to go through and there's no need to "check in" with your location.  All of that location data is bundled up, sent, and hidden from the user after they make a purchase, making the recommendation experience much less work for the user.  It's a better user experience in a world full of people who want to do less and get more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apple will likely take a route similar to the one Amazon did with its recommendations (which are scarily accurate), but apply it to both <span class="postImportantText">physical and digital</span> locations &mdash; something that Amazon has not yet been able to accomplish.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's a great idea, but they've got to get Apple Pay to stick.

You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/allergeez-food-allergy-assistant/id946316824?mt=8&uo=4" target="itunes_store">download it here</a> &mdash; I'd love some feedback.

			<h2 class="postTitle">A Mistake & An Icon<span class="postDate">December 13, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Allergeez became available on the App Store this morning, and that's as long as it stayed on there.  For some reason, the build that I used in the submission to the App Store was not the most current build that I used for beta testing, it was actually the build prior.  This build wasn't optimized to look great on bigger devices, and I knew this before going into beta testing.  Given that the build numbers looked very similar, I can see how this sort of thing happened.  But for some reason, I just can't really understand <i>how</i>.  I read over the entire submission form a ton of times before submitting it for review, yet I still made an error.  It's frustrating to know that I came this far, saw my app in the store, downloaded it, and immediately said to myself: "this isn't the right build."  But there's a lesson here.
				</p>
				<p>
					I made a mistake.  We all do.  It happened, and it's something that I can't change at this point.  I'll learn from this mistake.  I'll pay for it, in the form of a delayed release.  Next time I submit to the App Store, whether it be an update to Allergeez, or a new app, I'm going to be looking for the correct build number above all else.  It's an error I won't make again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, for the fun stuff.  During my study breaks for finals I've been working on an icon set I'm calling "Moosh."  It's always been a goal of mine to make an icon set, specifically for download in Cydia for Winterboard.  I've been designing the icons in Sketch, which is awesome.  Anyway, here's the Photos icon.  I had fun making this one!

			<h2 class="postTitle">On the Word &ldquo;Fine&rdquo;<span class="postDate">December 10, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					One word I absolutely cannot stand is the word "fine."  Examples: I'm fine, It's fine, I did fine.  None of these sound genuinely positive, and every time I hear these phrases, I have to cringe.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="postImportantText">Life is not worth being "fine."</span>  The word screams unsatisfied, and more often than not, unhappy.  I constantly tell my parents to stop being "fine" with things because they don't have any more time to waste.  When they tell me that they're fine with how things are going when they're doing something they don't want to do, I can't help but be upset.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have no interest in being fine, doing fine, or doing things that are fine, and you shouldn't either.  Doing fine work isn't doing good, great, excellent, or exceptional work; and that should be enough to make you want to do more than fine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doing fine work is what gets you a C in a class that you're clearly capable of getting an A in.  It's staying off of the radar.  You, and your work do not do anything risky, groundbreaking, or compelling.  This is because doing fine work doesn't require much thought at all.  <span class="postImportantText">Fine work requires the minimum amount of effort to get by</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Being fine is not taking control of your current situation, whether that be a relationship, job, friendship, or whatever else you can think of being fine with.  "Yea whatever, I'm cool with it, it's nothing huge but it's getting me by."  If you don't like something, change it.  If I find myself saying something is fine, I know I have to re-evaluate why I'm doing it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'll never forget the end of my internship last summer when I asked my mentor: "Did I do great, or did I do fine here?"  I asked my mentor to choose one.  If he said that I did fine, I knew I had failed myself.  I could not have felt happier to hear him say that I did great.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever I do things, I look at my work and ask myself if what I did is great, or if it's fine.  If in my eyes what I did is great, then I know that I have put everything I have into the project, and there's nothing better than realizing that.
				</p>
				<p>
					The people who do great things, are never the ones that are okay with being fine.

			<h2 class="postTitle">What's Next - Some Ideas<span class="postDate">December 9, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Finding that the average review time in the iOS App Store is <a href="http://appreviewtimes.com/" target="_blank">8 days</a> has me thinking about what's next.
				</p>
				<p>
					I mentioned my <span class="postImportantText">additive color game</span> a while back, called "Cewlers."  I've been working on mock ups in Sketch whenever I'm bored to morph the concept into a game, but it's definitely going to take a bit more dedication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since I jailbroke my original iPhone, I was obsessed.  I was blown away by the visuals developers were creating through themes, and the functionality they were introducing through tweaks.  Jailbreaking is what truly got me interested in programming back when I was in high school, and it has always been a goal of mine to make one of the two.  I'd love <span class="postImportantText">to make a theme</span>, but at the same time I'd love <span class="postImportantText">to code up a tweak</span>.  I just don't want to spend too much time in the world of jailbreak.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acne is something I've had to deal with for the entirety of my high scool and college life.  I spent years going to dermatologists, trying new products and home remedies.  If you can find a single positive review about it on the Web, I've definitely tried it.  The truth is, nothing worked for me &mdash; and that is one of the worst feelings ever.  When something bothers you and can't for the life of you find a solution or fix for it, you feel helpless.  On a whim, two months ago I was tested for food allergies, and found that I was allergic to a number of foods I was eating all the time (wheat, nuts, etc.).  After reducing my intake of these specific foods for a month or so, I found that my acne was no where near what it had been before.  I went from having huge whiteheads all over my face, to two red dots!  A positive change &mdash; finally, without wasting money on any facial products.  I'd love to find a way <span class="postImportantText">to get the word out about food allergy tests in the acne world</span>.  Tons of people think it's about what you put on your skin, but it's even more so about what you put into your body.
				</p>

				<p>
					These are just a few ideas I have for a new project.  I'm sure I'll pick something up during the holiday break!

When the app is approved (trying to stay positive here), I'll post some cool stuff involving my process in creating the app - I can finally be super specific and can include screenshots as well as the tons of icon iterations I went through.  If you're feeling eh about the name of the app...I've always liked to keep the names of my projects funky and fun, I can't help it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Part of the reason I was able to perform a lot of my device specific beta testing so quickly was due to the fact that I recently upgraded my phone to the iPhone 6 Plus.  I know, I can't believe I did it either.  I can't count the number of times I made fun of the massive phones people were sporting and how ridiculous they looked, especially when taking phone calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					I upgraded to the 6 Plus because I wanted to take a risk, and learn from it.  This is the first time Apple has offered a serious deviation from the standard 1 or 2 inch dimesion increase, and to be truthful, I was curious.  Not just of how the phone felt, but the implications this could have on the future of mobile phone usage, or even mobile technology in general.  Yes, I know big phones have been a thing for a while courtesy of Samsung.  I was thinking maybe using a drastically different device than I'm used to could help me learn about the future of mobile and where the technology could be going.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few days ago I was reading a super interesting <a href="https://medium.com/re-form/the-utopian-ui-architect-34dead42a28" target="_blank">Medium article</a> about an ex-Apple creative, Bret Victor.  Apple gave him an what is now known as the iPad, and basically asked him to determine whether the device could be something awesome, or not.  So cool.  It got me thinking that this is a path I'd like to take for a career.  Anyway, he had this quote that I just had to screenshot.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Back in the days of Roman numerals, basic multiplication was considered this incredibly technical concept that only official mathematicians could handle.  But once Arabic numerals came around, you could actually do arithmetic on paper, and we found that 7-year-olds can understand multiplication.  <span class="postImportantText">It's not that multiplication itself was difficult.  It was just that the representation of numbers - the interface - was wrong</span>."

			<h2 class="postTitle">Thanksgiving Beta Submission<span class="postDate">November 28, 2014</span></h2>

				<p>
					If only there was a gif of the scene from The Social Network when Zuckerberg first makes "The Facebook" live and just stares at his computer screen with a blank face.  I've done that so many times with <i>a lot smaller projects</i>, but the feeling is awesome.  It's like handing in a test you spent a week studying for.  I'm happy to say that I've <span class="postImportantText">submitted my app for review</span>.  But this isn't for App Store review - it's for beta testing.
				</p>
				<p>
					After reading a lot of documentation, I realized that I need to see what the app looks like on <span class="postImportantText">real</span> devices, not just in the simulator.  Given that I don't have every existing iOS device, I'm using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/testflight/" target="_blank">TestFlight</a> for beta testing.  I have no prior experience with TestFlight, but want to ensure that I get reports of how my app looks and functions on the entire iOS device family, such that I feel comfortable submitting the app to the App Store.  Having said this, layout is not the primary testing concern - it's actually ingredient number.  I want to be sure that the app has all of the relevant ingredients that can be found on foods/drinks in grocery stores, as it is in these stores where I feel the app is most useful for those with food allergies.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's a lot to be thankful for today, and this projects' journey is definitely one of them.  Happy Thanksgiving!

			<h2 class="postTitle">Some Field Testing<span class="postDate">November 20, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					Earlier tonight, I went to the grocery store to walk around and take pictures of labels of random foods and drinks in order to see if my apps' ingredients were exhaustive.  The answer was no - not exhaustive enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been on a number of websites that list tons of common ingredients, but a huge number of ingredients that were listed on the labels I found tonight, I had never seen before.  This was good.  Had I released the app with the old list of ingredients, before making this trip, I would have had an unsatisfied user base, waiting for updates.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I first started walking around, I picked up foods and drinks, and then typed every single ingredient from the labels into my app in order to see if it was in the data store.  My first observation of this was, "wow, this is annoying."  I mean some of these labels had close to 20 different ingredients - that's a lot of typing!  This sort of scared me.  I don't want users to feel the same way.  I then realized that sure, initially you're going to be typing every single thing you see on the label so that you're sure that the food/drink doesn't contain any harmful allergens.  But you'll learn, and you'll remember.  I know this because I do.  I remember which ingredients I need to avoid, and this comes from the repitition of looking this stuff up.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trip was only about 30 minutes long, but it yielded around 40 pictures, ranging from ice cream sandwiches to baked beans.  After going through the ingredient lists, I found that I was missing some ingredients that were common among all of the labels that I had taken pictures of, which was huge.  The trip was definitely successful.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lesson I've come to learn through the course of this project: when you've been working on a project for a relatively long time, it's easy to doubt your idea, and furthermore, yourself.  Don't let it happen.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Predictive Text Spacing<span class="postDate">November 17, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					The "Predictive" keyboard feature introduced in iOS 8 presents an interesting barrier if you're making an iOS app that depends on the vertical space between the top of the keyboard and another UI element.  What's more, I can't find an API method to disable/hide the feature for the keyboard in a textfield you're using in your app.  The only solution I've seen, is to completely disable auto correct...Sure, it makes your life easier as a developer, but it will make the lives of your users far worse if they have to keep backspacing for every word entered.  You take that sort of thing for granted after using it for so long.  I remember when the popover suggestions first came out as a feature, and I tried to turn off auto correct because I thought the popover suggestions were annoying...It was more annoying realizing how bad I was at typing <span class="postImportantText">without</span> auto correct.
				</p>
				<p>
					On my iPhone 5S I have the Predictive feature turned off, however on the Simulator, the feature is enabled.  This reminded me that I need to account for spacing between the top of the keyboard and the scroll view above it, whether the predictive feature was enabled or not.  In addition, I'd need to provide appropriate spacing in case the suggestion drawer was visible, or hidden (by pulling the drawer down).
				</p>
				<p>
					When testing on the 5s, things looked good - except when I tried turning on the predictive feature.  If I did this, a bit of the scrollView, positioned above the keyboard, would be covered (suggestion drawer open or not).  Not ideal.  Additionally, on the 4s, all of the scrollView was covered, with or without the predictive text.  When it came to any other devices, they were tall enough to not present an issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					The solution for this spacing issue was to do a nice constraint animation on the scrollView and all views above it, when the keyboard was about to come into view.  By matching the animation rate of the keyboard sliding up with the rate used to animate all the above views, you get an illusion that the keyboard is pushing the content up along with it.  This looked really nice and provided space for the predictive feature, enabled or not, drawer open or not.  When it came to the 4s, simply hiding any views that the keyboard overlayed as it slid up was enough.  Sliding the views above the keyboard up would result in the views being chopped off by the top of the screen, and a removal of context from the sentence (Is _ingredient_ Dairy Free?).
				</p>
				<p>
					App submission is next Monday - I've marked it as such.  I'm super excited to see how the app can help people with food allergies, like me.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Trimming Some UI Fat<span class="postDate">November 13, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I said I would stick with it, but I knew there was something off about my design.  I mentioned a while ago that my one qualm with the way I developed this app was that I let the design govern the functionality.  I knew I was doing it, but I really thought the Natural Language Form was sharp and wanted a cool way to put that technique into practice.  A made an excuse to put the design to work.  Ideally, I would have had the design supplement and improve the apps functionality.  Hind sight is 20/20, however.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since I first mocked up the apps' UI in Sketch, I've had a button fixed at the bottom of the screen that reads "Find Out."  In order to determine if the entered ingredient is allergen free, you type it in, and then tap the button.  This looked great in the mock up, but after a lot of use, I noticed that the button was actually becoming "fat."
				</p>
				<p>
					The "order of ops" for trying to find out if "milk" is gluten free are the following: Tap the text field.  1 tap.  Type in "milk" and hit enter.  We'll call that 2 taps total.  Tap the "Find Out" button.  3 taps.  This seems all well and good, but after doing further usability testing, almost every user asked, "Why can't it just search right when I press enter?"  My response, "- uh well, there's no reason it can't."  In my mind I'm thinking, "it doesn't feel right.""
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a classic case of getting too attached to my design.  I had considered this sort of functionality because in truth it is more efficient, 2 taps instead of 3.  Less taps, better experience (in this situation).  But I didn't pursue it because I liked the contrast the button provided to the interface, and this is why I started out by saying that I let my design control the functionality, in a bad way.  It was holding me back from making a slimmer experience by trimming the fat (button) from the interface.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is something I haven't faced before, as I normally start with a functional idea, and then generate the design, but the creation of this app was the opposite, which is kind of cool.  It's crazy that when you take things away in an interface, it more often than not makes it <span class="postImportantText">better</span>.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Ingredients and Cewlers<span class="postDate">November 8, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					The past few weeks have been super busy in school, so I haven't been able to devote as much time to this project as I'd like.  I thought configuring the layout across all devices using Auto Layout would be a sinch, however there is a bit of a learning curve there, so it took longer than a day for me to get everything just right...but damn is it helpful.  I can't imagine writing conditionals for each and every device, especially with the growing range of dimensions in iOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					I mentioned a while ago that I'm shooting to have this app released in the App Store by Thanksgiving, and I'm holding myself to that.  It gives me a realistic time constraint that keeps me moving forward, but more importantly makes me weigh feature decisions, which is invaluable, especially in a real work setting.  I want to be sure that I have an almost exhaustive list of ingredients for users to search through, so I'll be test driving the app during my next trip to the grocery store to find out how exhaustive it is thus far.
				</p>
				<p>
					This past weekend I took a trip to visit one of my bestfriends, and thought of a cool idea for a game involving additive color (an interest of mine).  Over the course of the flight I used Sketch to flesh out and mock up ideas for how the game would work...but of course my laptop ran out of battery.  I'm thinking this'll be my next project after I submit my food allergies app by Thanksgiving.  I'm calling the project "Cewlers."

			<h2 class="postTitle">A Cool Design Problem<span class="postDate">October 23, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I'm using a natural language form as the only view in my app.  So imagine the only objects on the screen being the words: Is _ingredient_ dairy free.  The only piece of text the user can interact with is the _ingredient_ textfield.  So apply a few different ingredients to the above text.  Is <i>corn</i> dairy free?  Is <i>spinach</i> gluten free?  Is <i>black beans</i> soy free?  Wait - what?  When the ingredient entered is plural, the natural language is no longer natural.  With ingredients, sometimes plurality is necessary without making the ingredient sound extremely unnatural.  So how should I deal with this?
				</p>
				<p>
					My first thought was: As soon as they hit the return key to hide the keyboard, and before they hit the search button, run a query to see if the food they entered is plural and then change the "Is" to "Are"...This is surely unnecessary overhead, and won't really make the experience any better.  The reason is because changing the "Is" to "Are" after the user has entered the ingredient is meaningless.  They've already thought about how to make the word not plural...aka they've already thought too much.  It would just be a weird experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					My current thought is to do the following.  Make the "Is" and the "Gluten Free?" labels swipe-able.  Imagine moving through photos in your Photos app on your phone.  Swipe left to move to a new photo, right to an old one.  I can apply the same concept here, but instead of photos, I'll make the labels swipe-able.  This gives the user this cool sense of power to form any sentence they want easily, but more importantly, it makes sense to them.  The cool part about this is that the choice from the "Is" or "Are" label is actually irrelevant.  It has no influence on the result of the query; it's purely there for the users benefit.
				</p>
				<p>
					I thought about this last night and haven't drawn anything out yet, but I can see a potential issue when it comes to affording the interaction.  I need to come up with the best way to let the user know: "Hey, you see those labels above and below where you type the ingredient in?  Yea, swipe right to get different ones."  I actually should rephrase the prior statement.  I need to come up with the most <span class="postImportantText">unobtrusive</span> way to show users that this functionality exists in order to keep my design as minimal as possible.  This is going to be a fun one.

			<h2 class="postTitle">"It Depends"<span class="postDate">October 21, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					After my trip to the grocery store, a few points of concern came to mind.  Is it okay to leave out ingredients that are on the edge of containing an allergen, or are an example of, "in some instances this may contain that allergen?"  It just seems like a bad idea to blanket an ingredient like "vodka" with a binary value.  The real reality is that <span class="postImportantText">it depends</span>.  It depends on a number of variables, which require deeper investigation, past the scope of this app.  So this means that the app will not include ingredients such as "applesauce" for example because <i>it depends</i> on how the applesauce was made.  It's better to be accurate and drill down into the ingredients of applesauce.  This way I'm not giving some users "false" information if they end up eating applesauce that happens to contain wheat.
				</p>

				<p>
					I will admit that I considered adding a field to each food in the data store regarding whether the allergen "depends."  The problem with this approach is that it will likely blur the line of scope that I defined in my prior post.  If I keep things down to their building blocks, I can minimize error.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then what should I do about ingredients such as alcohol?  Well, to be honest, I'm not sure yet.  My first thought was to remind my users that if the ingredient was not found via the search, <i>it depends</i>.  I'm not sure this is the correct path to take.  This means that an ingredient not being found versus one that was intentionally not included are equal.  This isn't right.  I know I'm not going to get every single ingredient out there.  But, I'm going to get damn close.  If I start to go down the path of <i>it depends</i>, I get dangerously close to brand land, where everything depends, and the amount of data is way too large.  I'll have to sit on this for a few days.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was also thinking down the road, if users search for an ingredient that couldn't be found, they could request it.  This seems like a nice way to build a solid community.  Additionally, if there was a allergen thought to be incorrectly assigned, they could contest it.  Just a thought, but it might make the app more complex then it really needs to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					Right now I'm going through a list of the most common ingredients <a href="http://www.food.com/library/all.zsp" target="_blank">here</a> and doing my research per each ingredient.  Obviously this isn't the only list of ingredients I'll look at, but it seems to be a solid starting point and will help jog my mind for how to deal with scenarios where, <span class="postImportantText">it depends</span>.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Finding the Right "Little Guy"<span class="postDate">October 21, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					With the help of <a href="http://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a> I was able to utilize a number of assets to give my app some life.  In looking for "a little guy" for my app - something like the Snapchat ghost as I mentioned earlier, I came across a set of icons by <a href="http://thenounproject.com/Julihan/" target="_blank">Julien Deveaux</a> which I really thought were great.  Especially the rolling pins.  This little guy felt perfect for my app, especially since a rolling pin is a key component when preparing food.  I feel weird buying the rights to the icon set considering I didn't create it, and come on, it's too cute.  I'll likely pay him attribution in the about of my app but I haven't decided yet.  Part of me feels like doing both is the right thing to do here, but this may not even be what the released version of the app looks like!
				</p>
				<p>
					Today I've been gathering as many ingredients as I can and making sure my sources are solid when it comes to logging associated allergens.  Like I said before, the apps' succcess depends on the reliability of its data.

				<p>
					I can't wait to give it a test run when I go to the grocery store later tonight.

			<h2 class="postTitle">How's This One?<span class="postDate">October 20, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I don't think I've asked that question more in a single day.  After 33 iterations, I think the icon is done.  Keyword here is "think."  If you think your apps' icon isn't important, I'll help you change your mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					The app icon has always been a vessel of integrity.  It says so much about your app and its reliability, without using a single word.  Obviously screenshots in the App Store help as well, but the icon is something that you want your users to relate to.  The relationship doesn't need to be a life experience.  It just needs to connect with them in some way.  That's enough to spark an off the cuff download due to curiosity.  The icon also has to link to the problem statement the app is addressing.  For this app, I want to make it easy for users to check if a food is dairy free.  That's it.  This issue of what to include in the icon made me think of another issue I hadn't yet considered.  Scope.
				</p>
				<p>
					What's the scope of this app?  Am I going to attempt to cover all possible foods?  What about all of the different brands of the same foods?  For example, do I want to have users enter "Heinz Ketchup?"  Ideally, yes.  But think of it from a broader scope.  This now theoretically tells the user that the app must/should have all of the different brands of ketchup as well.  The key thing here is <span class="postImportantText">the users expectations</span>.  After a single search, they now expect (although maybe subconsciously) the app to be able to give a result for all other ketchup brands.  If this is the way I scope the app, my users will surely be dissapointed when they don't get a result for a miscellaneous ketchup brand that may only be local to their state/country.  This is an easy way to let  users down.
				</p>
				<p>
					This means I need to constrain.  I need to alter the apps' problem statement, and let users know ahead of time what this app is, and what it is not.  It's simply unreasonable to consider gathering every food from every brand.  That's way too much data to gather alone, and then determine whether or not each food is dairy free.  So this means that "food" is not the right word choice in the problem statement.  Well, how about ingredients?  Anyone can look at the nutrition label of a food/drink to find its ingredients, but even then he/she can't be sure whether it doesn't contain dairy unless it's specified.  This is an opening.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I can amount a list of common ingredients, the building blocks of "foods," the app can help users achieve the same goal: determine if the food/drink is dairy free.  This however now becomes an app that potentially requires more than one lookup per food/drink, but I think this is a worthy trade-off.  The key will be to create an experience in which users don't mind sticking around.  That's usually the goal, isn't it?
				</p>
				<p>
					With my new problem statement in mind, and ideas for components of the app icon floating aroud in my head, I came upon another question.  Do I stop at determining whether or not foods are dairy free?  What about gluten, or soy free?  Those two are huge.  Other food allergies like nuts and eggs could be included, but maybe in a future release.  This isn't much more work if I stick to ingredients, and will make the target audience broader as well.  But again, the key here is data integrity.  The data for all of these food allergies needs to be correct and from the right sources.  Once one user complains, the whole app could be dubbed as "sketchy."
				</p>
				<p>
					The icon should probably include each of these allergies, and maybe future allergies to be added.  And probably a "little guy" that users can relate the app to.  Think about the Snapchat ghost.

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					After reading <i>a lot</i> of documentation, I finally understand the code used to preload data, found in many of the tutorials I mentioned in the prior post.  I was pretty upset because there are a decent number of sources that have the exact same Objective-C code, but none take the time to explain what's happening in the code itself.  They all basically have the same chunk of code, and then have a line of text after it saying, "Now build and run your app."  I understand that the explanation is most likely fluff for the experienced iOS developer, but for the novice developer, code by itself doesn't help.  Of course I'm also writing this app using Swift so that additional language translation, although a miniscule issue at this point, didn't help the complexity.  Anyway, enough complaining.  The point is, I plan on writing a tutorial on preloading data in Swift very soon.
				</p>
				<p>
					The preloading works quite nicely.  My current worflow begins with opening my "DataInput" app in the Simulator and adding any food through the app interface.  Upon being built and run, the app generates <i>one</i> sqlite file as opposed to the new default <i>three</i> different files that conform with the Write-Ahead Logging journaling system as of iOS7.  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1809/_index.html" target="_blank">Apple's docs</a> provide a simple code snippet to change the journal mode to rollback, which is a nice two-liner, to bring back a single sqlite file as the only build output.  I can then navigate to the Simulators Documents directory and grab the produced sqlite file, which will be full of data.  I copy this file and move it to my Desktop for easy access.  Next, I move the file from my Desktop into my target project in which I want to preload this data.  After this, all I have to do is run my target app and it copies this file from the bundle, into the Documents directory, if a file doesn't already exist there.  It's smooth sailing from there.  The user can then type in a food and the app checks the data store to figure out if the food matches anything in the store, and finally returns whether or not it contains dairy.
				</p>

				<p>
					Enough coding.  It's time to get going on an icon.  I'm tired of looking at the default "blueprint" icon.

			<article class="postBody">

				<p>
					I assumed XCode's Core Data interface would let you add initial data into your app so you could populate the store with some "default" data to work with.  Boy was I wrong.  Search after search led to what seemed to be roundabout solutions.  I eventually made it over to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdFAQ.html" target="_blank">Core Data docs</a>, and found there is no way to insert data into the store via the XCode interface like there is in phpMyAdmin (ugh).  I found a number of tutorials that said you can take the sqlite file from an existing app, and add it to your target project that you need the default data for.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although it took a tad bit longer than expected, I built an app that allows me to add any food into the data store, and it's associated boolean value for whether or not it is dairy free.  I can also view all of the foods in the data store in a list view.  The utilty here is that after adding a number of foods, I'll try the method described above, and attempt to copy the sqlite file from this app to my target project.  I know it sounds like this will be a total pain in the ass to input a ton of foods one by one, but I figured I could use the extra practice with Core Data.  It just seems weird that it takes this much work to get some default data in a store...maybe it's just me being new to the world of iOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once I have the app loading default data, I can do a legitimate round of usability testing.  The goal here will be to see how the app performs when I need it most: in the grocery store.

			<h2 class="postTitle">Rolling Pins and UI Wins<span class="postDate">October 13, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">
				<p>
					The app has come a long way.  For the past few days I've been focusing on the UI, and the interactions that I originally mocked up.  After the UI/UX was complete, I moved on to stocking the app with a set of test data in order to test the feasibility of the app in the real world (something I feel a lot of developers don't do).  Proving to be useful and fun through a number of my every day use cases, I moved on to my next task; figuring out how to store persistent data.
				</p>
				<p>
					My web-centric mind immediately thought, "Just build a RESTful web service and make a request to it every time the user wants to check if a food has dairy in it."  Sure, that'll work.  But the search to determine if something has dairy in it should be instantaneous.  There shouldn't be any sort of progress indicator.  That will wreck the experience for sure, especially in an app that has a single button in it.  I then realized that I could just store data in the app, and then just query that data set.  That eliminates the need for a web service, and the subsequent GET request via my app.

					On to Core Data!

				<code class="postCodeExample">
					var bottomBorder:UIView = UIView()<br />
					bottomBorder.backgroundColor = UIColor.whiteColor()<br />
					bottomBorder.frame = CGRectMake(0, textField.frame.size.height - (0.5), textField.frame.size.width, 1)<br />
					textField.addSubview(bottomBorder)
				</code>
				<p>
					This resulted in a nice thin border at the bottom of the TextView, but ironically I didn't like the way it looked.  Take <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WntrM6p.gif" target="_blank">this bar graph .gif</a> for example.  It walks through reducing a bar graph to produce a simpler, cleaner, and more succinct version of the original.  I lost the border, and liked the looked of a TextView with a transparent background.  Something about minimalism just gets me.  Using a natural language form I saw on <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/" target="_blank">Codrops</a> quite a white ago as inspiration, I had the design for a new app.
				</p>

					Wednesday night I was in the supermarket and kept checking whether certain foods had dairy in them.  I then recalled how repetitive, and somewhat annoying it is to go into my browser, go to google, ask if the food is dairy free, and finally click a link that may have the answer.  Now sometimes Google has the answer for you, but for unordinary foods, its more of a chore than anything else.
				</p>
				<p>
					From that night on, the plan was simple.  Create an app makes this more convenient to check, and make it look damn good.  It seemed like a relatively simple idea for a side project to ease myself into iOS rather than hopping directly into a more complex framework, that I admittedly wanted to do as soon as I fired up Xcode for the first time.
				</p>
				<p>
					And now I've got "an excuse to build."

					Last night I decided to start creating smaller goals for myself when it comes to my Swift/iOS adventure.  Before reading a line of Swift or iOS documentation I had quite ambitious goals that simply were not achievable in a reasonable time frame.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea here is to give myself a small target to hit every day when it comes to iOS.  Ideally, after a few weeks have passed, I should have enough exposure to the platform to determine a solid direction for achieving my larger goal (the group listening app I described a few days ago).
				</p>
				<p>
					Today's goal seemed like a no brainer to me, coming from a Web standpoint.  But borders aren't as straightforward on iOS or Android as they are on the Web.  The goal: <span class="postImportantText">Create a TextView with only a bottom border and a specific color for that border.</span>  iOS only supplies four TextView templates, and after some investigation, it seems that you need to import the <i>Core Animation</i> framework, which is also known as <i>Quartz Core</i>, to get some nifty borders going.  I'll start there and post an image of what I've got in the coming days.

			<h2 class="postTitle">A Blog is a Blog<span class="postDate">October 5, 2014</span></h2>

			<article class="postBody">
				<p>
					For the longest time, I've had "Add Blog to Website" as a task under my to-do list
					in <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/" target="_blank">Wunderlist</a>, but always had an excuse for why I couldn't get it done, and that excuse usually dealt with not wanting to invest "too much time" into the backend.  However I've come to realize no matter what language or framework you utilize to write the blog in, it has the same main function, and that's to display your thoughts.  So for the time being, I'll be using a static HTML page (crazy, I know), and that's it.  Dead simple, and dirt cheap on time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I know it sounds like I'm making up an excuse, but the truth is, as I get older, I have less time on
					to devote to these sort of things.  This is the unfortunate truth that I've come to realize over the past few years, and I don't like it one bit.
				</p>
				<p>
					But in the spare time that I do have in between classes, work, and homework, I've been knee deep in Apple's relatively new programming language, Swift.  I exhausted every course available on my favorite source for programming videos, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, and have been searching all corners of the web for instructional videos, tutorials, documentation, you name it, I'm trying to read about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why the new infatuation with Swift, or iOS for that matter?  Well, I've always been a Web guy.  For the past three or so years all I was interested in were Web technologies.  I was surrounded by this sort of "web bubble" in which I felt comfortable, because I was so knoweldgeable in this department, and this is a bubble I seriously regret getting stuck in.  I almost felt scared of diving into mobile development, psyching myself out resulting in a negative mindset.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckily, over the past summer my eyes were opened to the world of mobile, and not the mobile web (my eyes were getting dried up over this topic), the world of mobile apps.  Working with Android, I was able to get my feet wet in all of the awesomeness of mobile devices.  One of my most satisfying moments early in the summer was simply getting haptic feedback from a button-press, which seems like nothing, but it was the start of as I mentioned earlier, an infatuation with mobile development.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the past few weeks, I've been gearing my iOS learning toward an idea I've had for quite some time.  The idea, without getting too specific before it has come to fruition, is a way to listen to music together, seemlessly (I really don't want to give up the idea so I'm trying to be as abstract as possible).  I'll use this blog as a host for my reflections on this project, and will most likely post mock ups created in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'll keep the following posts' word counts much smaller and to the point, however I had to set the stage...I read somewhere, probably in an article on <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>, that when you write about what you're thinking or working on, you think deeper, and get more out of the experience as a whole.  I'll use that as my excuse to keep posting here.  Oh, and before I forget, time to cross "Add Blog to Website" off of my to-do list!

					Check out <a href="http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/" target="_blank">Cupcake Ipsum</a> and <a href="http://www.lebowskiipsum.com/" target="_blank">Lebowski Ipsum</a> (a bit more vulgar).  I usually use one of the two to set up the skeleton of my design when I'm working on the sites basic layout.  Here's a <i>taste</i> of Cupcake Ipsum; it always makes the layout process a little less <i>vanilla</i>.
